# NextAuth.js (Example, if you were to use NextAuth.js - not currently in use for basic JWT)
# NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:9002" # During development
# NEXTAUTH_SECRET="SOMESECRET"

# Admin Credentials (For basic JWT auth, not for NextAuth.js)
ADMIN_EMAIL="admin@example.com"
ADMIN_PASSWORD="yoursecurepassword"

# JWT Configuration (For basic JWT auth)
AUTH_COOKIE_NAME="admin-auth-token" # Name of the cookie that stores the JWT
JWT_SECRET="your-very-strong-and-long-jwt-secret-key-at-least-32-characters" # A strong secret for signing JWTs
JWT_EXPIRES_IN="1d" # How long the JWT is valid for (e.g., 1d, 7d, 2h, 30m)

# Public Base URL (Important for API calls from Server Actions in production)
# For Vercel/Netlify, this is usually set automatically (e.g., VERCEL_URL, URL).
# For other platforms, you might need to set it manually.
# Example for local development (if not using localhost:9002 by default):
# NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL="http://localhost:9002" 
# Example for production:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL="https://yourdomain.com"
